The product catalog contains 400 items. Data is crawled daily and stored in the Data Lake(MinIO/S3).
The ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process moves the data into the Data Warehouse(Postgres). The processed data is
then transferred to PowerBI for visualization and to Streamlit to deploy Machine Learning models.

## ðŸ”¦ About Project
<img src='img/pipeline.jpg' style="width: 100%;">

- **Data Source**: This project uses two main `data sources`: [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and [Finnhub Stock API](https://finnhub.io/)
   - `Yahoo Finance API`: Data is collected from `Yahoo Finance's API` using the `yfinance` library, collected in `real time` with an interval between data points of `1 minute`, collected data includes indicators such as `Open`, `Volume`, `Close`, `Datetime`,...
   - `Finnhub Stock API`: Data is collected from `Finnhub's API` in `real time`, collected data includes `transaction` indicators such as `v (volume)`, `p (last price)`, `t (time)`,...
 - **Extract Data**: After being collected, data will be written to `Kafka (Kafka Producer)` with different `topics` for each different `data source`.
 - **Transform Data**: After data is sent to `Kafka Topic`, it will be read and retrieved using `Spark Streaming (Kafka Consumer)` and performed `real-time processing`. `Spark` is set up with `3 worker nodes`, applying `Spark's` distributed nature in large data processing.
 - **Load Data**: At the same time, when the data is processed, it will be loaded directly into the `Cassandra` Database using `spark`.
 - **Serving**: Provide detailed insights, create `financial reports` with `Power BI`, and `analyze` investment performance to guide strategic decision-making and optimize portfolio management.
 - **package and orchestration**: Components are packaged using `Docker` and orchestrated using `Apache Airflow`.
